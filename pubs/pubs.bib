    Abstract = {Dynamic taint analysis can be used as a defense against 
    		low-integrity data in applications with untrusted user interfaces.  
    		An important example is defense against XSS and injection attacks 
    		in programs with web interfaces. Data sanitization is commonly used 
    		in this context,  and can be treated as a precondition for endorsement 
    		in a dynamic integrity taint analysis.  However, sanitization is often 
    		incomplete in practice.  We develop a model of dynamic integrity taint 
    		analysis for Java that addresses imperfect sanitization with an in-depth 
    		approach.  To avoid false positives, results of sanitization are endorsed 
    		for access control (aka prospective security), but are tracked and logged 
    		for auditing and accountability (aka retrospective security). We show how 
    		this heterogeneous prospective/retrospective mechanism can be specified 
    		as a uniform policy, separate from code.  We then use this policy to 
    		establish correctness conditions for a program rewriting algorithm that 
    		instruments code for the analysis.  The rewriting itself is a model of 
    		existing, efficient Java taint analysis tools.},

  abstract = {The major goal of this dissertation is to enhance software security by 
		provably correct enforcement of in-depth policies. In-depth security 
		policies allude to heterogeneous specification of security strategies 
		that are required to be followed \textit{before} and \textit{after} 
		sensitive operations. Prospective security is the enforcement of 
		security, or detection of security violations before the execution of 
		sensitive operations, e.g., in authorization, authentication and 
		information flow. Retrospective security refers to security checks 
		after the execution of sensitive operations, which is accomplished 
		through accountability and deterrence. Retrospective security frameworks 
		are built upon \emph{auditing} in order to provide sufficient evidence 
		to hold users accountable for their actions and potentially support 
		other remediation actions. Correctness and efficiency of audit logs play 
		significant roles in reaching the accountability goals that are required 
		by retrospective, and consequently, in-depth security policies. This 
		dissertation addresses correct audit logging in a formal framework.

		Leveraging retrospective controls beside the existing prospective 
		measures enhances security in numerous applications. This dissertation 
		focuses on two major application spaces for in-depth enforcement. The 
		first is to enhance prospective security through surveillance and 
		accountability. For example, authorization mechanisms could be improved 
		by guaranteed retrospective checks in environments where there is a 
		high cost of access denial, e.g., healthcare systems. The second 
		application space is the amelioration of potentially flawed prospective 
		measures through retrospective checks. For instance, erroneous 
		implementations of input sanitization methods expose vulnerabilities in 
		taint analysis tools that enforce direct flow of data integrity policies. 
		In this regard, we propose an in-depth enforcement framework to mitigate 
		such problems. We also propose a general semantic notion of explicit flow 
		of information integrity in a high-level language with sanitization. 

		This dissertation studies the ways by which prospective and retrospective 
		security could be enforced uniformly in a provably correct manner to handle 
		security challenges in legacy systems. Provable correctness of our results 
		relies on the formal Programming Languages-based approach that we have 
		taken in order to provide software security assurance. Moreover, this 
		dissertation includes the implementation of such in-depth enforcement 
		mechanisms for a medical records web application.}

		balancing purposes or in the event of system failure/upgrades. 
		This reconfiguration event, referred to as \textit{data migration}, 
		must be completed efficiently as the system tends to perform sub-optimally 
		during such process. The data-migration problem has been studied extensively 
		in the literature with efficient algorithms presented for  homogeneous 
		(all storage disks have similar capabilities)  and heterogeneous 
		(storage disks can have different capabilities) cases. 

		In this paper, we investigate adding \textit{data forwarding} to existing 
		algorithms for the heterogeneous data migration problem. In data forwarding, 
		we introduce additional storage nodes (called bypass nodes) during the 
		migration process. Our simulations show that  adding as few as 2 bypass 
		nodes with limited capabilities can improve the performance by up to 15\% 
		and adding more bypass nodes with heterogeneous capabilities can improve 
		the migration performance by 25\%. We then present a novel algorithm that 
		makes intrinsic use of bypass nodes and show that the algorithm can always 
		achieve an optimal migration schedule while adding no more than 
		$ \alpha \times n/3$ bypass nodes where $n$ is the numbers of disks and 
		$\alpha$ is a term defined to reflect the heterogeneity factor of disks.},
