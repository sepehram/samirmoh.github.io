<blockquote>
Information-algebraic models have been shown as effective semantic frameworks in the 
		specification of audit logging requirements. These semantic frameworks underlie 
		implementation models that formally guarantee correctness of audit logs. Recently, 
		one such implementation model has been proposed for concurrent systems. In this paper, 
		we study the deployment of an instrumentation tool based on this implementation model, 
		aiming at microservices-based applications that are built by Java Spring framework. 
		This tool instruments these applications according to a given logging specification, 
		described in JSON. A set of events in one or more microservices may necessitate the 
		generation of log entries in a specific microservice. Instrumentation of an application 
		enables different microservices of that application to concurrently generate audit logs.

 Towards an indoor navigation system using monocular visual SLAM.

<blockquote>
This paper presents a novel implementation of an augmented reality-aided indoor 
		navigation system for mobile devices. The proposed system uses the deviceâ€™s camera 
		to scan the environment, generate an abstracted 3D map of the indoor environment, 
		and transfer it to a remote server. The 3D map of the indoor environment is achieved 
		through a tracking and mapping ARKit module. Once the indoor map is stored in the 
		server, it can be accessed simultaneously by multiple devices for localization and 
		navigation. Leveraging Unity assets and the directions retrieved from the server, 
		the application computes the shortest distance between the source and destination, 
		and displays AR-based direction markers for navigation assistance.

 Correct audit logging in concurrent systems with negative triggers.
 Technical report, University of the Pacific, June 2021.
[&nbsp;<a href="pubs_bib.html#amirmoh-tr21">bib</a>&nbsp;| 
<a href="https://sepehram.github.io/pubs/tr21.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
In previous work, we had proposed the semantics of correct audit logging in concurrent 
		systems using information algebra, and then had proposed an implementation model in 
		&pi;-calculus that instruments programs to generate correct audit logs according to 
		the proposed semantic framework. The proposed instrumentation algorithm receives audit 
		logging requirements specified in Horn clause logic that specify a collection of events 
		(positive triggers) as preconditions to log.  In this work, we extend the formal 
		specification of audit logging requirements with negative triggers (along with positive 
		ones) to boost the expressivity of the audit logging policies, i.e., a collection of 
		events that should not happen as precondition to log. This way, our language of audit 
		logging requirement specifications goes beyond Horn clauses. We show that the original 
		instrumentation algorithm is potent enough to emit programs that 
		generate correct audit logs at runtime.

 A semantic framework for direct information flows in hybrid-dynamic

<blockquote>
Hybrid-dynamic models provide an underlying framework to study the 
  		evergrowing cyber-physical systems with an emphasis on the integration 
		of their discrete computational steps and the associated continuous physical 
		dynamics. Ubiquity of cyber-physical systems necessitates some level of 
		assurance about the secure flow of information through different discrete and 
		continuous components. In recent years, different logical frameworks have 
		been proposed to analyze indirect information flows in cyber-physical systems. 
		While these frameworks are used to verify secure flow of information in a 
		metalevel, they naturally fall short in support of implementing information flow 
		analyzers that could effectively enforce policies at runtime. This practical 
		limitation has triggered the implementation of direct information flow analyzers 
		in different language settings. In this paper, we focus on direct flows of 
		information confidentiality in hybrid-dynamic environments and propose a 
		semantic framework through which we can judge about such flows. This 
		semantic framework can be used to study the correctness of enforced policies 
		by these analyzers, and in particular taint tracking tools. In this regard, we 
		specify a dynamic taint tracking policy for hybrid dynamic systems and prove 
		its soundness based on the proposed semantic framework. As a case study, 
		we consider the flow of information in a public transportation control system, 
		and the effectiveness of our enforced policy on this system.

 Correct audit logging in concurrent systems.

<blockquote>
Audit logging provides post-facto analysis of runtime behavior for 
		different purposes, including error detection, amelioration of system 
		operations, and the establishment of security in depth. This necessitates 
		some level of assurance on the quality of the generated audit logs, i.e., 
		how well the audit log represents the events transpired during the execution. 
		Information-algebraic techniques have been proposed to formally specify this 
		relation and provide a framework to study correct audit log generation in a 
		provable fashion. However, previous work fall short on how to guarantee this 
		property of audit logging in concurrent environments. In this paper, we study 
		an implementation model in a concurrent environment. We propose an algorithm 
		that instruments a concurrent system according to a formal  specification of 
		audit logging requirements, so that any instrumented concurrent system 
		guarantees correct audit log generation. As an application, we consider systems 
		with microservices architecture, where logging an event by a microservice is 
		conditioned on the occurrence of a collection of events that take place in 
		other microservices of the system.

 Maybe tainted data: Theory and a case study.

<blockquote>
Dynamic taint analysis is often used as a defense against 
		low-integrity data in applications with untrusted user interfaces. 
		An important example is defense against XSS and injection attacks 
		in programs with web interfaces. Data sanitization is commonly used 
		in this context, and can be treated as a precondition for endorsement 
		in a dynamic integrity taint analysis. However, sanitization is often 
		incomplete in practice. We develop a model of dynamic integrity taint 
		analysis for Java that addresses imperfect sanitization with an in-depth 
		approach. To avoid false positives, results of sanitization are endorsed 
		for access control (aka prospective security), but are tracked and logged 
		for auditing and accountability (aka retrospective security). We show how 
		this heterogeneous prospective/retrospective mechanism can be specified 
		as a uniform policy, separate from code. We then use this policy to 
		establish correctness conditions for a program rewriting algorithm that 
		instruments code for the analysis. These conditions synergize our previous 
		work on the semantics of audit logging with explicit integrity which is an 
		analogue of noninterference for taint analysis. A technical contribution of 
		our work is the extension of explicit integrity to a high-level functional 
		language setting with structured data, vs. previous systems that only address 
		low level languages with unstructured data. Our approach considers endorsement 
		which is crucial to address sanitization. An implementation of our rewriting 
		algorithm is presented that hardens the OpenMRS medical records software system 
		with in-depth taint analysis, along with an empirical evaluation of the overhead 
		imposed by instrumentation. Our results show that this instrumentation is 
		practical.

 Data migration in large scale heterogeneous storage systems with

<blockquote>
In large scale storage systems such as data centers,  the layout of data 
		on storage disks needs to be frequently reconfigured  for load 
		balancing purposes or in the event of system failure/upgrades. 
		This reconfiguration event, referred to as <i>data migration</i>, 
		must be completed efficiently as the system tends to perform sub-optimally 
		during such process. The data-migration problem has been studied extensively 
		in the literature with efficient algorithms presented for  homogeneous 
		(all storage disks have similar capabilities)  and heterogeneous 
		(storage disks can have different capabilities) cases. <p>
		In this paper, we investigate adding <i>data forwarding</i> to existing 
		algorithms for the heterogeneous data migration problem. In data forwarding, 
		we introduce additional storage nodes (called bypass nodes) during the 
		migration process. Our simulations show that  adding as few as 2 bypass 
		nodes with limited capabilities can improve the performance by up to 15% 
		and adding more bypass nodes with heterogeneous capabilities can improve 
		the migration performance by 25%. We then present a novel algorithm that 
		makes intrinsic use of bypass nodes and show that the algorithm can always 
		achieve an optimal migration schedule while adding no more than 
		 &alpha;&#215;<em>n</em>/3 bypass nodes where <em>n</em> is the numbers of disks and 
		&alpha; is a term defined to reflect the heterogeneity factor of disks.

 <em>A Formal Approach to Combining Prospective and Retrospective
  Security</em>.
 PhD thesis, The University of Vermont, July 2017.
[&nbsp;<a href="pubs_bib.html#amirmoh-phd-thesis">bib</a>&nbsp;| 
<a href="https://sepehram.github.io/pubs/thesis.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
The major goal of this dissertation is to enhance software security by 
		provably correct enforcement of in-depth policies. In-depth security 
		policies allude to heterogeneous specification of security strategies 
		that are required to be followed <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> 
		sensitive operations. Prospective security is the enforcement of 
		security, or detection of security violations before the execution of 
		sensitive operations, e.g., in authorization, authentication and 
		information flow. Retrospective security refers to security checks 
		after the execution of sensitive operations, which is accomplished 
		through accountability and deterrence. Retrospective security frameworks 
		are built upon <em>auditing</em> in order to provide sufficient evidence 
		to hold users accountable for their actions and potentially support 
		other remediation actions. Correctness and efficiency of audit logs play 
		significant roles in reaching the accountability goals that are required 
		by retrospective, and consequently, in-depth security policies. This 
		dissertation addresses correct audit logging in a formal framework.<p>
		Leveraging retrospective controls beside the existing prospective 
		measures enhances security in numerous applications. This dissertation 
		focuses on two major application spaces for in-depth enforcement. The 
		first is to enhance prospective security through surveillance and 
		accountability. For example, authorization mechanisms could be improved 
		by guaranteed retrospective checks in environments where there is a 
		high cost of access denial, e.g., healthcare systems. The second 
		application space is the amelioration of potentially flawed prospective 
		measures through retrospective checks. For instance, erroneous 
		implementations of input sanitization methods expose vulnerabilities in 
		taint analysis tools that enforce direct flow of data integrity policies. 
		In this regard, we propose an in-depth enforcement framework to mitigate 
		such problems. We also propose a general semantic notion of explicit flow 
		of information integrity in a high-level language with sanitization. <p>
		This dissertation studies the ways by which prospective and retrospective 
		security could be enforced uniformly in a provably correct manner to handle 
		security challenges in legacy systems. Provable correctness of our results 
		relies on the formal Programming Languages-based approach that we have 
		taken in order to provide software security assurance. Moreover, this 
		dissertation includes the implementation of such in-depth enforcement 
		mechanisms for a medical records web application.

 Noninterference in a predicative polymorphic calculus for access

<blockquote>
Polymorphic programming languages have been adapted for 
    		constructing distributed access control systems, where a program represents
	    a proof of eligibility according to a given policy.  As a security 
    		requirement, it is typically stated that the programs of such languages

	    is then proposed through logical relations.  We prove a type soundness
