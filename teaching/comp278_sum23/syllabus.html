<h2 align="left">Course Description</h2>
<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
This course offers a comprehensive study of the principles and practices of computer system security including operating system security, network security, software security, and web security. Students will learn common threats and vulnerabilities, along with basic principles and techniques when designing a secure system. Hands-on labs will help students gain an understanding on how to think like an adversary, how modern cyber-attacks and defenses work in practice, and how to assess threats and protection mechanisms.

We rigorously enforce the University's policy and procedures as stated in the <a href="http://www.pacific.edu/Documents/student-life/judicialaffairs/Tiger%20Lore%20Code%20of%20Conduct%202016-17.pdf">Honor Code</a>.
 At the first suspicion of violation of this code, the case will be
immediately forwarded to the  Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards.<br>
<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>All work is to be an individual effort by default. Group assignments will be explicitly stated as being so.</li>
<li>Although true research into course topics is encouraged, the course
textbook and class notes are the only sanctioned sources of information
for homework and exam solutions. <i>In particular, solution sets
obtained via unsanctioned means-- from friends, from online, or from
taking the course previously-- are <b>not sanctioned</b> and any discovered use of them will be considered a violation of academic integrity</i>.</li>
<li>The instructor is available for outside help, during office hours,
by email, and by appointment. </li>
<li>It is your responsibility to protect your own work. </li>
<li><i><u>All work that is suspected to violate the Honor Code will be referred directly to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards.</u></i></li>
<li>We recommend that you read University's <a href="http://www.pacific.edu/Documents/student-life/judicialaffairs/Tiger%20Lore%20Code%20of%20Conduct%202016-17.pdf">Honor Code</a>.</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>
</p>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
The Honor Code at the University of the Pacific calls upon each student to exhibit a high degree of maturity, responsibility, and personal integrity. Students are expected to:</p>
<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Act honestly in all matters</li>
<li>Actively encourage academic integrity</li>
<li>Discourage any form of cheating or dishonesty by others</li>
<li>Inform the instructor and appropriate university administrator if she or he has a reasonable and good faith belief and substantial evidence that a violation of the Academic Honesty Policy has occurred.</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>
<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
Violations will be referred to and investigated by the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. If a student is found responsible, it will be documented as part of her or his permanent academic record. A student may receive a range of penalties, including failure of an assignment, failure of the course, suspension, or dismissal from the University. The Academic Honesty Policy is located in Tiger Lore and <a href="http://www.pacific.edu/Campus-Life/Safety-and-Conduct/Student-Conduct/Tiger-Lore-Student-Handbook-.html">online</a>.
</p>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
<b><i>Course-specific Honor Code Policy: </i></b>Engineering is generally a cooperative endeavor and collaborative learning can be a valuable experience for all involved. However, proper assessment (i.e., grading) requires that work be done by individuals. To balance these two requirements, the following policy will apply:</p>

<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Collaborative work on course assignments is encouraged. This includes working together on planning solution strategies and helping each other to debug programs.</li>
<li><i><u>Collaboration must stop short of someone else writing your assignment.</u></i> You may not directly copy the work of another student. You also may not copy the work of another student, and then modify it so that it does not look the same as the original author's work. It is your responsibility to ensure that the work you submit is an honest representation of your own understanding of the material.</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
Marginal cases will be resolved by oral examination of the student(s) involved. If they each understand the material in the assignment, it will be considered honest collaboration. If they do not, then it will be considered academic dishonesty.
<p>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
In many cases, it may be possible to identify reusable source code from textbooks, web sites or other resources that can help you with assignments.  You are permitted to use such references provided that:
<p>

<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>The amount of code reused does not exceed 25% of the total assignment length, and</li>
<li><i><u>In the source code comments, you clearly identify any code that you did not write,</u></i> state where it came from, and to what extent you modified it. </li>
</ul></ul>
</div>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
You are responsible for understanding the theory behind all algorithms or source code used, regardless of their source.</li>
