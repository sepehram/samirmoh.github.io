<h2 align="left">Course Description</h2>
<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
This course aims at introducing deep neural networks as an effective approach in constructing machine learning-based solutions. The course helps students in the design and development of neural networks in a given application domain, using hands-on approach. Topics include tensors, learning basics, artificial neural networks, and convolutional neural networks among other topics.
</p>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
<b><i>Prerequisites:</i></b> COMP 053 and ECPE 170
with a "C-" or better.  <!--Note that these
are <i>recommendations</i> and may be waived at instructor's discretion.
-->
<br>
<i>When enrolling in this course, you should be relatively proficient in
using Python. In addition to being a competent Python programmer, you should have an understanding of partial derivatives and gradients, probability, and using common data structures, e.g., lists, arrays, maps, classes, etc.
We will use PyTorch to develop models and train them. 
Beforehand knowledge of PyTorch is not required.

Violations will be referred to and investigated by the Office of Student

<b><i>Course-specific Honor Code Policy: </i></b>Engineering is generally
a cooperative endeavor and collaborative learning can be a valuable
experience for all involved. However, proper assessment (i.e., grading)
requires that work be done by individuals. To balance these two
requirements, the following policy will apply:</p>

<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Collaborative work on course assignments is encouraged. This includes
working together on planning solution strategies and helping each other to
debug programs.</li>
<li><i><u>Collaboration must stop short of someone else writing your
assignment.</u></i> You may not directly copy the work of another student.
You also may not copy the work of another student, and then modify it so
that it does not look the same as the original author's work. It is your
responsibility to ensure that the work you submit is an honest
representation of your own understanding of the material.</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
Marginal cases will be resolved by oral examination of the student(s)
involved. If they each understand the material in the assignment, it will
be considered honest collaboration. If they do not, then it will be
considered academic dishonesty.

In many cases, it may be possible to identify reusable source code from
textbooks, web sites or other resources that can help you with
assignments.  You are permitted to use such references provided that:

<li>The amount of code reused does not exceed 25% of the total assignment
