<h2>Course Materials</h2> We will use the
textbook <u><i>Computer
Networking: A Top-Down Approach (6th Edition)</i></u> by Kurose and Ross.  Purchase
of the textbook provides access to a
<a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_kurose_compnetw_6/">companion
website</a> containing all course materials, including powerpoint
slides, programming assignment descriptions and templates, and other
resources such as Applets that illustrate core concepts.  
<i>Purchase of this textbook is mandatory and other texts, including earlier editions of this textbook, will not be supported</i>

<hr size="4"><a name="Grading"></a>
<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
Final grades will be assigned based on several performance 
factors.  These factors and their quantitative contribution to 
the final grade are as follows:
<p><font ="+0"=""></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font ="+0"="">Homework and programming assigments: 70%, broken down as follows--<br>
<ul>
<li> Problem sets (Biweekly): 40%
</li><li> Major programming assignments (3 total): 30%
</li></ul>
</font></li>
<li><font ="+0"="">In-class exams: 30%, broken down as follows--<br>
<ul>
<li> Midterm: 15%
</li><li> Final: 15%
</li></ul><br>
</font></li>
</ul>
<h3>Attendance</h3> Class attendance is mandatory. Attendance will be checked. <b><i>More 
than three unexcused attendances will result in a 10% reduction of the final grade. </i></b>
<font ="+0"="">
<br><br>
</font><hr size="4">
<h2><font ="+0"=""><a name="ExamSched">Exams</a></font></h2> Two exams
will be conducted during the semester, a midterm and a final.  The

via Blackboard, or in class on pencil-and-paper when appropriate.
Submissions are accepted until 11:59PM on the due date.
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Late policy:</b></i> assignments will be accepted up

</a></font></p><h2><font ="+1"=""><a name="AcademicIntegrity">Academic Integrity</a></font></h2><p></p>
We rigorously enforce the University's policy and procedures as stated in the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/%7Euvmppg/ppg/student/acadintegrity.pdf">Code of Academic Integrity</a>.
 At the first suspicion of violation of this code, the case will be 
immediately forwarded to the University Coordinator of Academic 
Integrity.
<ul>
<li><font ="+1"="">ALL work is to be an individual effort by default. Group assignments will be explicitly stated as being so.
<font ="+1"="">
</font></font></li>
<li>Although true research into course topics is encouraged, the course 
textbook and class notes are the only sanctioned sources of information 
for homework and exam solutions. <i>In particular, solution sets 
obtained via unsanctioned means-- from friends, from online, or from 
taking the course previously-- are <b>not sanctioned</b> and any discovered use of them will be considered a violation of academic integrity</i>.<br>
</li><li><font ="+1"=""><font ="+1"="">The instructor is available for outside help, during office hours,
by email, and by appointment. </font></font></li><font ="+1"=""><font ="+1"="">
<li>It is your responsibility to protect your own work. </li>
<li><i><u>All work that is suspected to violate the Code of Academic 
Integrity will be referred directly to the Coordinator of Academic 
Integrity
in the Provost's Office.</u></i> 
</li><li>We recommend that you read <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/%7Euvmppg/ppg/student/acadintegrity.pdf">UVMâ€™s Code of Academic Integrity</a>.</li></font></font></ul><font ="+1"="">
