The vision for this course is: <i>What do I, as a computer scientist, need to understand about the fundamental concepts in programming languages and what are the different features by which I can realize whether a given programming language is appropriate in a given project?</i>
</p>
<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
There are two main themes in this course:
<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>The internal structure of programming languages, and how we can deploy them</li>
<li>Different paradigms of programming (beyond object-oriented)</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
<b><i>Attendance:</i></b> 
Class attendance and participation is necessary and expected. There will be numerous activities in class, and these activities cannot be made up outside of class.  Participation requires that you are properly prepared for classroom discussions and activities, and have completed all reading assignments before the relevant class. <!--<b><i>Note that more than three unexcused absences will result in a 10% reduction of the final grade.</i></b> -->

You will only be allowed <i><u>three excused or unexcused class misses</u></i> during the semester. The only acceptable excuses for missing a class, an assignment due date, or an 
exam are serious illness, family emergency or important professional, academic or athletic activities. Illness or 
family emergency may require documentation. Excuses for professional, academic or athletic activities must be 
approved by the instructor in advance.  

Students missing a class are responsible for making up the material discussed in that class on their own. 
Students are responsible for being aware of any announcements made during their absence.

<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Act honestly in all matters</li>
<li>Actively encourage academic integrity</li>

If a student is found responsible, it will be documented as part of her or his permanent academic record. A student may receive a range of penalties, including failure of an assignment, failure of the course, suspension, or dismissal from the University.

<b><i>Course-specific Honor Code Policy: </i></b>Engineering is generally a cooperative endeavor and collaborative learning can be a valuable experience for all involved. However, proper assessment (i.e., grading) requires that work be done by individuals. To balance these two requirements, the following policy will apply:</p>

<div class="box" align="justify">
<ul><ul>
<li>Collaborative work on course assignments is encouraged. This includes working together on planning solution strategies and helping each other to debug programs.</li>
<li><i><u>Collaboration must stop short of someone else writing your assignment.</u></i> You may not directly copy the work of another student. You also may not copy the work of another student, and then modify it so that it does not look the same as the original author's work. It is your responsibility to ensure that the work you submit is an honest representation of your own understanding of the material.</li>
</ul></ul>
</div>

<p class="firstpara" align="justify">
Marginal cases will be resolved by oral examination of the student(s) involved. If they each understand the material in the assignment, it will be considered honest collaboration. If they do not, then it will be considered academic dishonesty.
